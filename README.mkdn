My script for automatic configuration for my rails development serving.

I combine this with a hosts file line:

  127.0.0.1 project.dev
  
And a vhost:

  <VirtualHost *:80>
  	ServerName 		project.dev
  	RewriteEngine On
  	RewriteCond 	%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  	RewriteRule		(.*) http://localhost:3200$1 [P]
  </VirtualHost>
  
See rappaport.yml.example for example project definitions.
